# Reversi
This was a project that I worked on for my Object-Oriented Programming class (CS180 - Purdue University). Reversi or "Othello" is a game in which you start with two players try to turn the board into their color of chip. Chips can only be placed as the incorporated chip outflanks one or more of the opponents placed chips. To outflank means that a single chip or one straight row of chips of the opponent is in both sides next to its own chip, with no empty squares between all those chips. Once a chip is placed, the outflanked chips flip and become the opposite color. If there is more than one outflanked row, then all the chips in those rows are flipped as well. If no turn can be made, then the turn is forfeited, and it is once again the opponents turn.
